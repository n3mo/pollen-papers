With pollen, it's easy to emphasize your writing with ◊em{italics}, ◊b{bold text}, ◊u{underlining}, and even ◊em{◊b{◊u{all three at once}}} (but why would you want to?). With ◊link["https://github.com/n3mo/pollen-papers"]{pollen-papers} you can forget about html and CSS design and focus instead on writing your document. The goal of this project is simple: to make writing academic-style documents---the kind students typically write for undergraduate papers---simple and easy. The templates provided simplify common functionality needed by writers:

◊items{
	◊item{Easy bullets.
	     ◊items{
	           ◊item{Even nested bullets}}} 
	◊item{The in browser experience provides a rendered view of your document similar to what you might expect in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor such as Microsoft Word. Margins are 1" by default. In the html-view, there are no page breaks, letting you instead focus more on the text of your document without worrying about page breaks.}
